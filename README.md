# Welcome
[Serenity UI](http://serenityui.com) templates are sample applications that demonstrate the use of the [Serenity UI](http://serenityui.com) library and provide a template for creating your own applications. This repository contains the source code for Serenity UI templates provided in the [Serenity UI Template Gallery](http://serenityui.com/Widgets/Gallery).

The templates provided in this repository are:

- Calendar: A sample application modeled after Google Caendar.
- Performance: A sample application for tracking goals for a performance period and achievements for each goal.
- Northwind: coming soon!

Check out the [Serenity UI Roadmap](http://serenityui.com/Support/Roadmap) to see what new sample applications will be coming soon to the Template Gallery.
