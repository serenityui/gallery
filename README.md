# Welcome
[Serenity UI](http://serenityui.com) templates are sample applications that demonstrate the use of the [Serenity UI](http://serenityui.com) library and provide a template for creating your own applications. This repository contains the source code for Serenity UI templates provided in the [Serenity UI Template Gallery](http://serenityui.com/Widgets/Gallery).

The templates provided in this repository are:

- Calendar: An interactive calendar application modeled after Google Calendar. [demo](http://serenityui.com/templates/calendar/index.html)
